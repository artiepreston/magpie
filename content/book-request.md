# Request a book

Not keen on looking through our bookshelves? Can’t say we get it, but we’ll do it for you!

If there's something you're looking for and you're willing to wait, add it to our book request list. If we happen to come across a copy, we'll send you a message and, once you confirm you still want it, you can come and pick it up!

For this service, we ask for a minimum donation of £1 or 30% of the book’s recommended donation, whichever is higher. (If you want to read more about our pay what you can pricing, checkout our [about page](/about))

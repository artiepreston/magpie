# Give us your books

We are always accepting donations!

We take: fiction, non-fiction, old books, new books, good books, bad books, childrens’ books and adults’ books. The more the merrier! If you think we’re joking, we’re not. We like to shelf and display books that might be harder to find in traditional second hand shops, such as novels or non-fiction from marginalised authors. But we are not above selling the classics! We can make sure your favourite novel finds a new home, or dispose of your problematic pile through arts and crafts. We truly let nothing go to waste.

While we wait for our street trader license to be approved, we can come pick up your donations (within reason)! Find out how to contact us through our [about page](/about).
